      <h1 class="title" id="llm-translation">LLM based Translation</h1>
      <div class="project-content">
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to create a LLM-based professional translator from English to French in the healthcare domain using a specifically curated dictonary.
          <br />
          I took part in the prompt engineering of the model and its evaluation.
          <br />
          <br />
          Topics : Prompt engineering, LLM evaluation, LLM based translation.
          <br />
          Tech stack: Python, OpenAI, NLTK, FastAPI.

      <h1 class="title" id="ai-textbook">AI powered School Textbook</h1>
      <div class="project-content">
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to create an AI-powered digital textbook to help Korean elementary school students learn English more effectively.
          <br />
          It includes a students page with LLM generated quizzes, and a teachers page to follow up on the students' progress.
          <br />
          I took part in the implementation of a chatbot answering questions about the digital textbook and its functionalities.
          <br />
          <br />
          Topics : Text embedding, Vector Search.
          <br />
          Tech stack: Python, Transformers, NLTK, FastAPI.

      <h1 class="title" id="sound-vibration-analysis">Sound and Vibration Analysis</h1>
      <div class="project-content">
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to create a no-code platform to help engineers analyze sound and vibration data from electric cars using various Deep Learning models such as CNNs, RNNS, and LSTMs.
          <br />
          It includes a dashboard to visualize and preprocess the data, an interface to train classification and anomaly detection models from scratch, and a model deployment section to deploy trained models.
          <br />
          I took part in the creation of the whole platform, from the architecture design to the final deployment.
          <br />
          <br />
          Topics : MLOps, AutoML.
          <br />
          Tech stack: Python, Pytorch, FastAPI, MLflow, Ray, Onnx.

      <h1 class="title" id="robot-arm">Robot Arm Control</h1>
      <div class="project-content">
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to train and evaluate the <a href="https://openvla.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenVLA</a> model, a Vision Language Action model, on a specially created dataset for robotic arm.
          <br />
          I took part in the implementation of the model training and inference pipelines, and the development of the IsaacGym simulator used to evaluate the model's performance.
          <br />
          Dataset and models soon available on <a href="https://www.aihub.or.kr/" target="_blank">AIHub</a>.
          <br />
          <br />
          Topics : VLA models, robot, simulation.
          <br />
          Tech stack: Python, Pytorch, Transformers, IsaacGym.

      <h1 class="title" id="ai-excavator">AI Excavator</h1>
      <div class="project-content" style="padding-bottom: 20rem;">
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to develop a suite of AI models capable of controlling an excavator to perform a range of tasks on construction sites, including digging, lifting, and Leveling.
          <br />
          I specifically took part in the implementation, training and evaluation of an excavator bucket trajectory generation model based on geometric features of the terrain to dig.
          <br />
          We used a Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) based system coupled with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as the shaping force modulator to generate the trajectory of the bucket.
          <br />
          <br />
          Topics : trajectory generation, AI based heavy equipment.
          <br />
          Tech stack: Python, Pytorch.
